# 🎬 Movie Recommendation App

This is a simple, beginner-friendly **Movie Recommendation Web App** built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **scikit-learn**. It recommends movies based on genre similarity using **cosine similarity**.

The app was built as part of my learning journey in data science and web development. It demonstrates key skills such as:
- Data analysis
- Machine learning (content-based filtering)
- Web app development (Streamlit)
- Cloud deployment

---

## 📂 Project Features:
- Recommends similar movies based on genre.
- Uses `pandas` for data manipulation.
- Uses `scikit-learn` to calculate similarity.
- Built with `Streamlit` for an interactive web interface.
- Deployed publicly on Streamlit Cloud.

## 📚 How It Works:
1. Loads movie data from `movies.csv`.
2. Converts movie genres into numerical vectors using **CountVectorizer**.
3. Computes similarity between movies using **cosine similarity**.
4. Displays recommended movies based on the user's selected movie.
